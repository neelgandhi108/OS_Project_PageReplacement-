# OS_Project_PageReplacement-
Page Replacement Algorithms in Operating Systems In an operating system that uses paging for memory management, a page replacement algorithm is needed to decide which page needs to be replaced when new page comes in.
Types of Page Replacement Algorithms Implemented
There are various page replacement techniques, and we will explain each one
● FIFO Page Replacement Algorithm
● LIFO Page Replacement Algorithm
● LRU Page Replacement Algorithm
● Optimal Page Replacement Algorithm
● Random Page Replacement Algorithm
